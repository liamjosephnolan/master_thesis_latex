\section*{\centering Abstract}
The advancement of laparoscopic surgical robotics has contributed significant progress to the field of minimally invasive surgery; however, their high cost limits widespread adoption in research and training efforts. This system utilizes low-cost, off-the-shelf hardware to produce an accessible development platform for research purposes. It leverages ROS 2's distributed framework to improve real-time system performance and enable future software architecture scalability. Advanced system identification methods were employed to characterize the system, and an adaptive control strategy was implemented to compensate for varying system dynamics throughout the range of motion. Experimental validation demonstrates that the ROS 2-based architecture, in combination with the advanced system identification and control methods, provides significant performance improvements over the previous implementation. The results confirm the feasibility of a cost-effective surgical robotic system with advanced, adaptable control strategies, contributing to the advancement and accessibility of the next generation of robotic-assisted surgical systems.
