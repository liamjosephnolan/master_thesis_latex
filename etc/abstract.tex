\section*{\centering Abstract}

The advancement of laparoscopic surgical robotics has contributed significant progress to the field of minimally invasive surgery; however, their high cost limits widespread adoption in research and training efforts. This system utilizes affordable, off-the-shelf hardware to produce an accessible development platform for research purposes. The system utilizes ROS 2's distributed framework in an effort to improve real-time system performance and enable future software architecture scalability. Advanced system identification methods were employed to characterize the system, and an advanced control strategy was designed around this characterization. Experimental validation has demonstrated the system's ROS 2 based architecture in combination with the advanced system identification and control methods reduced system positional error by up to 92.1\% over the previous implementation while also offering improved system scalability. The results found through these experimental tests confirm the feasibility of a cost-effective surgical robotic system with advanced control strategies, contributing to the advancement and accessibility of the next generation of robotic assisted surgical systems.
